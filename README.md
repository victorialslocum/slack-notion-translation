# Slack and Notion are not super compatible 
### But I made that a lot easier :tada:

Are you trying to save your Slack messages to a Notion database through code because you can't afford Zapier like me? Well, you're in luck. 
Here's everything you need (almost) to translate a Slack message to Notion.  

# Features
### Emojis :smile:
Turns out, Slack emojis don't translate to Notion pages :cry:. That's ok though, because I did it for you :tada:.   
### Links :link:
Guess what? Text [links](http://endless.horse/) don't work either! Now they do though...  
### Text formatting :pencil:
- text formatting for 
  - `code`
  - [links](https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/)
  - **bold text**
  - *italicized text*
  - ~~strikethrough~~
  - bullet points
  - (I think) ordered lists  
### Tagged users :people_holding_hands: 
If you mention a user in Slack, it'll tag them in Notion, as long as you set up the correct dictionary!!

# Anyways...
:wave: Hi, I'm Victoria, and you can find my website [here](https://victoriaslocum.com) and the blog post for this page [here](https://comingsoon.com).   

I also used this in a larger project to integrate standups from Slack to Notion, and you can find that [here](https://github.com/victoriaslocum752/standup-integration).
